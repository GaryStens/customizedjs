**customizedjs** is a module that is JavaScript but it's customized.

You can do alot of things here!
Get started by importing the module:

```
npm install customizedjs
```

Here is the sample code here:

```
const { Import, Export, If } = require('customizedjs'); // Don't use the Export() function since we don't support it anymore

TEST = Import('<enter a module here>'); // Seems different

If (<value>, <return something>); // Return a single code
If (<value>, [<return 1>, <return 2>]); // Return multiple codes
```


the **Import** module uses the normal **require** statement with different errors and dosen't support files.
